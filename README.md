# RIOT-photo-tag

By using <b>RIOT tags</b>, we can create the basic structure and re-use it as many times we like. We basically just need to update the content on the `index.html` document. In this case, it was created a `<photo-tag>` that will check if the image has caption and display it, otherwise, it will display a thumbs-up icon. I re-used this photo tag, adding a different `img src` and `caption` each time.

Just take a look for yourself! https://ab4464.github.io/RIOT-photo-tag/

NOTE: It won't work in Safari, try with Chrome instead!
